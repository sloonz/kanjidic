This is a really simple Kanji Dictonary written in Ruby/GTK. It allows you to find
kanjis by:
 - Fuzzy skip code
 - Multi-radical search
 - Similar kanjis

This is achieved by the integration of three different databases :
 - The famous kanjidic2.xml file
 - kradzip.zip file, for multi-radical search
 - kanji.free.fr database containing similar kanjis

To use it, just run ./kanjidic. If you want to rebuild the database
from these sources, just run make in the "utils" directory. This will
generate a kanjis_db file, to put in the same directory that the
main executable.
